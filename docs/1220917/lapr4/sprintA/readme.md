## Engineering Process


| Level | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| 0 - Unacceptable| Did not use|
| 1 – Attempt	| The engineering process is very incipient, with almost no evidence of technical documentation or many errors. |
| 2 – Many Defects |	There is already a significant set of engineering artefacts, but the engineering process has evidence of significant errors (e.g. incorrect order of activities, lack of justification when moving between activities/phases of the process) or significant flaws in good practices and techniques that students should apply. |
| 3 – Some Defects |	There is evidence of a globally correct engineering process, although there may be small flaws in documentation or some activities with errors or missing (e.g. lack of testing) as well as small flaws in the application of good practices and techniques. There may be some inconsistency between code and design. |
| 4 – Correct |	The engineering process is correct. Code and design are completely aligned. Failures in the application of good practices and techniques are almost meaningless. |
| 5 - Exceptional |	The engineering process is correct (order of activities). Code and design are completely aligned. Very good justification of the process followed/applied. Application of good practices and techniques is exemplary. |

**Selected Level:** Not applicable

**Justification and Evidences:**

    In this iteration, the use of engineering process was not required as the implementation of code and other associated data was not specified.
