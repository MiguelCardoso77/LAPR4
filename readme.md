# Project Jobs4U

## 1. Description of the Project

Jobs4U is a company specialized in talent acquisition. The company provides recruitment services for job positions in its clients. The aim of this project is to develop, in an exploratory way,
a solution that allows automating the main activities of the company. Therefore, a minimum
viable product should be developed in 3 months.
The companyâ€™s clients are other companies or entities that need to recruit human resources.
In response to requests from its clients, Jobs4U develops all activities that allow it to select a
set of candidates for job offers (from its clients). At the end of the process, Jobs4U must deliver
to its client an ordered list of candidates for each job offer. The final recruitment decision is
the responsibility of the client.
